    <h3>Production</h3>
    <p>The filming of the first season of Stranger Things lasted for six months.[1] They spent eleven days filming each episode.[2]

        The first scene they shot was the Dungeons & Dragons scene from the first episode. The Duffers were concerned about how the child actors would work together on set, but to their relief “Our boys flew through the scene effortlessly and energetically, and their chemistry was electric; they felt like they had known each other their whole lives.”[3]</p>

     <h3>About</h3>
     <p>Breaking Bad, American crime drama television series created by writer and producer Vince Gilligan. It aired 2008–13 on the American Movie Classics (AMC) cable network. The title is a colloquial expression from the South, meaning “to raise hell.” The show was a popular and critical success and a breakout series for many of its cast members, in particular its lead actor Bryan Cranston.</p>
     <H3>Production</H3>
     <p>On June 14, 2010, AMC announced that Breaking Bad was renewed for a fourth, 13-episode season.[15] The writers began brainstorming and writing for the season in early July 2010.[16] At the 2011 Television Critics Association press tour, it was announced production on the season would begin January 13, 2011.[17] Filming ended in mid-June of that year.[18] Although the writing staff knew the fourth season would focus on the feud between Walter White and Gus Fring, they did not plan the season before production began, but rather developed the story as the episodes progressed. This followed a pattern similar to that of the third season and differed distinctly from the second season, where the season was planned in advance. Gilligan compared the fourth season to a "13-episode chess game" between Gus and Walt.[19]

        Originally, mini episodes of four minutes in length were to be produced before the premiere of the fourth season but these did not come to fruition.[20][21] the actor, Bryan Cranston, commented that the season would debut in July 2011 in an interview with New York Magazine, he also said, regarding the premiere date, that "It was a decision from AMC that they wanted to position us in July... They want to attract as many eyeballs as possible, away from the heavy competition of the September, November [or] January start.</p>

        <h3>Production</h3>
        <p>On June 10, 2022, Amazon Prime Video renewed the series for a fourth season.[42] According to showrunner Eric Kripke, figuring out a way to save Ryan's soul is a key priority for Butcher in the fourth season, with Kripke saying it's like Kramer vs. Kramer (1979) combined with Avengers: Endgame (2019).[43] On December 4, 2023, Kripke hinted that a scene from the fourth season might include "the batshit craziest thing" ever filmed for the series and expressed his own surprise that he "got away with it".[44] He also teased how each episode this season will play out, saying: "I think every episode has at least one totally fucking bananas moment. I love the ones in episode five. Episode six makes me cover my mouth with my hands every time I watch it. So, I think there's lots of good stuff going on.</p>
